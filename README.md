# Smart-attendance-system
The Smart Attendance System is a Python-based AI solution that automates attendance marking using facial recognition and Google Drive cloud integration. The system processes a classroom group photo to generate instant lists of present, absent, and unrecognized students by comparing detected faces against a stored dataset of four reference images per student. The dataset is securely stored and managed on Google Drive for easy access and scalability, with options for uploading, downloading, and updating student images. An interactive Streamlit interface allows users to reupload photos of unrecognized students, immediately updating the attendance list. Built with OpenCV, face_recognition, and Google API Client, the system ensures fast, accurate, and reliable attendance tracking for modern educational environments.
